Executive Summary 
WebMD is an online publisher of health and wellness news and information. The site contains an extensive volume of drug-related information and it is one of the most popular healthcare websites in the U.S. Scraped from the WebMD website. our data includes around 0.36 million unique reviews that were updated until March 2020. The dataset also contains user evaluations of individual medications, as well as information on linked ailments, side effects, age, sex, and overall patient satisfaction ratings. In the project, we have utilized the NLTK packages and various types of classifiers such as decision tree, random forest and naive bayes to achieve the desired results.

The project aims to extract advanced understandings and focuses on automating sentiment analysis on drug reviews in WebMD. More particularly, by examining those reviews in great detail, the project provides significant insights into parents' diverse conditions, summarized drug ratings, numerous medications classes, and sentiments from patients, ultimately constructing the most ideal combination of feature representation methods and classifiers that could predict a patientâ€™s satisfaction given a particular drug. 

Business Goal Analysis
With analyses generated from the WebMD reviews, our goal is not only to establish sentiment ratings but also to predict future ratings by using machine learning algorithms. To automate such a process and significantly improve its efficiency, text analytics plays an imperative role since the majority of our data is heavily textual. Data visualizations are also an inseparable component of our project. More detailedly, the data visualizations include topics of drug ratings, medications classes, and patients' differentiated conditions.  To achieve the business goal, we conducted data preprocessing, data cleaning, data consolidation and management, feature engineering, classification representations, and eventually data mining with different classifiers.
